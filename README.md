Simple project made with the "django" framework for python. It consists of a web page with registration, login, logout. 

The page is set to a "cinema" and therefore has movies and series, which all have categories and are related to each other.

It also has an administration panel from which, if the user is admin, absolutely everything can be managed; how to add or edit articles 
(either movie, series or category), edit users and even add new pages. 

As a database it uses sqlite and the framework itself is in charge of doing the migrations.
